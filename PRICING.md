## **Service Deployment Fee**  
**10.00 TON** (one-time)  

### Why is this needed?
- üõ† **Smart Contract Deployment**: Your personal ECVRF service requires a dedicated smart contract deployed to the TON blockchain.  
- ‚õΩ **Covers Maintenance Costs**: This fee includes gas and infrastructure for contract setup and maintenance.  
- üîí **Infrastructure Bloat Protection**: Protects the system from the bloat of infrastructure, ensuring real customers will receive randomness as quickly as possible.  

---

## **Pay-As-You-Go**
**1 TON** per request  
*Best for:* Testing or low-volume usage.   
- Pay per individual randomness request  
- No upfront commitment

## **Subscription Plans**  
Pre-purchase requests at reduced rates:

| Tier          | Requests | Total Cost | Cost/Request | Savings vs. Pay-As-You-Go |
|---------------|----------|------------|--------------|---------------------------|

   - Save **550 TON** on 1000 requests vs. pay-as-you-go  
   - Save **7000 TON** on 10000 requests vs. pay-as-you-go  
3. Pre-paid requests never expire  
4. Automatic deduction from your balance
